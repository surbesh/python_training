# In python, We don't have primitive data type like in some
# languages we used declare the variables and store the values BUT
# in python we will create object and store the values

a = 10
# Internally it will create object of 'int' class and store the values

# OR we can also store the values like
b = int(10)

print(a, b)

# All the operators like +, -, *, / etc are supported
