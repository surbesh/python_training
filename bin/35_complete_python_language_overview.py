In this section 2 things

1. What python-library means?
2. Complete python programming language structure
"""

# 1. What python-library means?
# ---------------
# - python library can be a one or more modules like mymodule.py
# - python library can be a one or more package like mypackage
##################################

# 2. Complete python programming language structure
# ---------------
# PART-1: Python Programming Language
#       - data types, if, for, while, functions, classes, exceptions handling
#           etc
#       - Using PART-1: We can develop anything from the scratch
#       - We developed: program-1 to program-5
#
# PART-2: builtins
#       - Few variables, functions & classes are predefined
#       - by default imported
#       - Complete list: print(dir(__builtins__))
#       - We already use: print, int, float, str, list, tuple etc
#       - Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#
# PART-3: Standard Libraries
#       - Few libraries are getting installed when we install python
#       - Location: C:\Python312\Lib
#       - Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#
# PART-4: 3rd Party / External Libraries
#       - This is MAIN BIG repository
#       - Location: https://pypi.org/
#       - Documentation: https://pypi.org/
#
# PART-5: Custom Libraries
#       - Libraries we develop
#       - We already developed 2 libraries
#           1) mymodule.py
#           2) mypackage
